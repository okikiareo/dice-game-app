        <h2>The rules of the game</h2>
        <p>- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.</p>
        <p>- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.
        </p>
        <p>- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.</p>
        <p>- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After
            that, it's the next player's turn.</p>
        <p>- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.</p>
        <p>- A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6'es in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn.
        </p>
        <p>- Players can set the winning score (in an input field), so that they can change the predefined score of 100.
